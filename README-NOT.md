R security practices
====================

This is a repository of guidance materials to help people improve the security of R usage.

The core guidance is available in the [book](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/r-security-practices).

Who this is for
---------------

This work is aimed at three (often overlapping) types of people involved with R -- users, developers, and administrators.

Motivation
----------

The R community is pretty awesome but as a lot of us aren't trained developers, we can inadvertently do things that are security boo-boos or open us to bad people taking advantage of our systems. I'm sure we'd like to avoid that!

## Working with the file system
In R you can work with the file system. R can do anything you can do with files across your network so you need to be careful.

#### Principles
- Interact with files through pre-defined interfaces geared towards the type of file you want to access
- Use relative references

#### Good examples

### File locations
- Working directory
- Network files

### File permissions
- Execute permissions
- Groups

### Cleanup
- The use of `on.exit`
- The use of `unlink`

## Unsafe sourcing
Don't source files from the internet without checking them!

You should understand something entirely before you execute it and you should verify that a file is the same file you were expecting.

Using the package `notary`, you can do this easily:
```{r}
library(notary)
```

## Dynamic string creation & SQL injection


#### Principles
- Always cleanse parameters that are input by a user

#### Good examples

##### Using DBI
Here we accept a user's input to some code that constructs a request to the database in a safe way.

This uses DBI but you can also use RODBCext if you use RODBC for interfacing with your database package.

```{r}
doDBcall <- function(input){
  basesql <- "SELECT * FROM iris WHERE species = ?species"
  sqltoexecute<-DBI::sqlInterpolate(DBI::ANSI(), basesql, species = input)
  # send SQL to the DB with DBI::dbExecute()
  return(sqltoexecute)
}

doDBcall("setosa")
doDBcall("virginica';DROP TABLE iris;")
```

##### Using shiny
A common thing you might do is make it easy for someone to analyse some data dynamically, by allowing them to change columns. We use the column names to constrain choices instead of letting people type answers in - this is also a better user experience too!

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(shiny)
shinyApp(
  ui=fluidPage(selectInput("x","X-axis",
                    choices=colnames(iris)[-5]),
        selectInput("y","Y-axis",
                    choices=colnames(iris)[-5]),
        plotOutput("myplot")),
  server=function(input, output) {
    output$myplot<-renderPlot(plot(iris[,input$x],iris[,input$y]))
  }
)
```

#### Bad examples
##### Using DBI
```{r}
doDBcall <- function(input){
  basesql <- "SELECT * FROM iris WHERE species = '"
  sqltoexecute<-paste0(basesql,input,"'")
  # send SQL to the DB with DBI::dbExecute()
  return(sqltoexecute)
}

doDBcall("setosa")
doDBcall("virginica';DROP TABLE iris;")
```

##### Using shiny


#### Background
[SQL Injection](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection) aka SQLi is one of the most common security issues in web development, and yet is one of the easiest to avoid.

SQLi occurs where a user can input text in an unconstrained manner and what they input isn't sanitised to prevent them ending the statement you were expecting to execute early and adding their own followup statement.

## Password handling
- Never store passwords in files that go into source control!

<Info on how to store keys safely>

## System calls
You can execute any command-line code from R. This gives you a lot of access to functionality that can be dangerous!
